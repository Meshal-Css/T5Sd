# Week 9 Progress

This week, I focused on two main areas:
- **Data Visualization:** I learned how to effectively present and analyze data using various visualization techniques. This includes creating charts, graphs, and plots to communicate data insights clearly.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** I explored OCR technologies to extract and recognize text from images, which can be used in various applications such as document digitization and automated text recognition.

It was a productive week with significant progress in both skills!
